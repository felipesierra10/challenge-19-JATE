## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? to build a text editor app that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application and it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also be able to function offline.

## User Story
